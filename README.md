PSMetadataLib
=============

PSMetadataLib is a work-in-progress library for parsing files related to metadata on PlayStation systems, currently focused on the PlayStation 3. Support for basic PS4 and PS5 formats is being worked on, as is support for PS2 Memory Cards.

A use case of this could be identifying PlayStation games without using an internet connection, using the data provided by the game directly.

This project is licensed under the MIT license. Please see more details in the LICENSE.txt file.

I would like to thank the contributors of the PlayStation Developer Wiki (https://www.psdevwiki.com/) for documenting so much about the file formats PlayStation systems use.
